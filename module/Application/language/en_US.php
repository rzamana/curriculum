  'Full Bio' => '<p>At the end of 2003, with almost 20 years old,

My first book "PHP & MySQL", I didn\'t knew it how much 
this will define my future. Started with the basic, 
missing a lot, creating a some sistems with few security, 
now everything starts with a good API to be consumed.</p>
<p>Already developed small sistems and big ones, 
learned other programming languages, and I still 
manage to take 2 certifications (one already expired). </p>
<p>Heard a lot about agil sistems and scrum (really helpfull), 
using pomodoro on my free time, so I can handle to keep studying.</p>
<p>I have my personal cluster, with 3 servers running linux (ubuntu), 
two of which are with containered services, 
and the third is being migrated to docker.</p>
<p>My github has always been very slow, 
because my first dedication is with the company I\'m working with, 
so I always ended up with little time for personal projects 
(and still the repositories are private).</p>
<p>I learned 2 new languages, one for taste (English) 
and other for work (Spanish), and all times 
I get information on these languages and many others that 
make me want to learn (German, Chinese, etc).</p>
<p>I decided to do this curriculum with ZendFramework 3. 
Why?!? Because I didn\'t know this framework and wanted
to create something with it.</p>'
